#### Pre-course message

Dear students,

this message contains important information about our course Programmieren mit Python, please read carefully:

- please **fill out the very short pre-course survey** in WueCampus until Friday, February 14
- there will be a beginner and an advanced group (you can decide for yourself, which one to join)
- the course **starts next week on Monday, February 17 at 9:00 am** for everyone
- after that, the beginner and advanced groups will meet at different times via Zoom (see tentative schedule in wuecampus)
- between meetings you will work through assignments on your own machine
- please **perform the setup steps** outlined in wuecampus and verify that it works
- if you have any problems with the setup, let me know until Friday, February 14 (so best do the setup now)
- join the Zoom meetings with the device you use for programming so you can potentially share your screen

I'm looking forward to seeing you all next week.
Markus Ankenbrand

### Pre-course survey

- **English or German**: Do you prefer to have this course in English or German?
- **Prior experience**: Have you ever worked with Python before? yes/no
- **Other languages**: Have you programmed in any other programming languages? Which ones?
- **Reading code**: Do you understand what the following Python code does? And would you feel comfortable explaining it to the class? yes (understanding)/yes (understanding and explaining)/no

```python
l = [1, 4, 6, 9, 2, 4, 3]
m = l[0]
for i in l:
  if i > m:
    m = i
print(m)
```

- **Writing code**: Do you feel comfortable writing Python code to solve the following problem and explaining it to the class? yes (coding)/yes (coding and explaining)/no

Given two lists (l1 and l2) with an equal number of elements, create a third list, l3, that contains the smaller of the two numbers from l1 and l2 at that position:

```python
l1 = [1, 4, 6, 9, 2, 4, 3]
l2 = [3, 2, 1, 6, 3, 7, 2]
# task: write some code that produces
l3 = [1, 2, 1, 6, 2, 4, 2]
```

## Setup Instructions

This is a hands-on course, so you will practice programming in Python using your own computer. Therefore, you need to install some required software:

- [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (with [python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extensions)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (advanced group)

Please follow the instructions linked above, to first install Minforge (follow the instructions closely) and then VS Code. Then install the extensions from within VS Code. If you plan to attend the advanced group, install Git, as well.

To finalize and test the installation, create a folder for the python course and open this folder in VS Code. Create a new file called "test.ipynb" and create a new "Code" cell in the created notebook. Enter "1+1" and click the little play icon to run the code. You will be prompted to install required packages. After confirming and waiting a minute, the result "2" should show up under the cell (see screenshot). ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you are all set ðŸŽ‰

### Monday

#### Tasks

- work through Chapter 2, "Python at the Lab Bench"
- follow along with the code examples by manually typing them into a jupyter notebook (in VS Code)
- execute the code examples and try some modifications
- write down any questions and problems that occur, and we'll discuss them in the afternoon session
- when you are done, try to solve the exercises

#### Exercises

1. Write a function `fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperature)` that can convert Fahrenheit to Celsius and a function `celsius_to_fahrenheit(temperature)` that does the reverse
2. Write a function `is_leap_year(year)` that tells whether any given year is a leap year or not

#### Important Concepts

- Variables and Types (float, int, string, boolean (True/False))
- Comments
- Code blocks (indentation)

- try to implement the final `restrictionDigest` function (from the end of the chapter) without typing it 1-to-1
- when you are done, try to solve the exercises

#### Exercises

1. Write a function `subsequence_positions(sequence, subsequence)` that takes a sequence and a subsequence as a string and returns a list of all positions where the subsequence occurs within the sequence
2. Write a function `subsequences_positions(sequence, subsequences)` that takes a sequence as a string and a list of subsequences and returns a dictionary with each subsequence as keys and a list of all positions where that subsequence occurs within the sequence as values

#### Important Concepts

- when you are done, try to solve the exercises, you'll need the following additional tutorials:
- walk through the first two `pandas` tutorials: "[What kind of data does pandas handle](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_table_oriented.html)" and "[How do I read and write tabular data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/02_read_write.html)"
- walk through the [basic `matplotlib` tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/pyplot.html)

#### Exercises

1. Calculate the results of `biomarker(pDisease, 0.8, 0.04)` with `pDisease` taking all values from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.05. Store the results in a list.
2. Create a pandas `DataFrame` with two columns `pDisease` and `biomarker` with the values from the previous exercise and save it as `biomarker.csv`.
3. Plot the result from exercise 1 using `matplotlib`, with `pDisease` on the x-axis and `biomarker` on the y-axis.

#### Installation

```
mamba install pandas
```

in Miniforge Prompt (Windows), Terminal (mac OS, Linux)

#### Important Concepts
